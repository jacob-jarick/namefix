High:

* generate filename from id3 tags
* make filter and directory text box resize with the main window.

Medium:

* jpeg and other picture tag support.

* JPEG metadata stripping for privacy (remove GPS, camera info, EXIF data)
  - Use Image::ExifTool library (avoid Tk::JPEG dependencies)
  - CLI options: --strip-exif, --strip-gps, --strip-privacy
  - GUI: checkbox option in misc tab with granular controls
  - Risk: Additional library dependency for Windows PP deployment
  - Consider external tool integration (exiftool.exe) as alternative

Low:

* multi level undo - dismissed, not really a scalable idea for file renaming.

==================

* truncate from middle will round down to nearest even number
  - this is not a problem in my eyes.

* Unicode characters are supported, but some weirdness may occur on some
  systems depending on systems unicode support & codepages supported.
