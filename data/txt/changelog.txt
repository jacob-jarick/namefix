4.1.4 - Windows deployment improvements and build optimisation

* Fixed Windows PP deployment JPEG display issue with robust 3-tier fallback system:
  - Tier 1: Attempt Tk::JPEG module (preferred)
  - Tier 2: Fallback to PPM file conversion if JPEG module fails
  - Tier 3: Text description if image unavailable
  Applied to both jpgtest utility and about dialog

* Optimised build system for Windows executables:
  - Removed data bundling from executables (NSIS installer provides data files)
  - Reduced GUI executable size from ~130MB to 6.69MB  
  - Reduced CLI executable size to 5.71MB
  - Added PAR archive builds (GUI: 1.16MB, CLI: 244KB)
  - Improved build script with silent operations and clean output
  - Fixed batch script PAR build hanging issues

* Updated NSIS installer:
  - Changed output filename from namefix.pl_install.exe to namefix-installer.exe
  - Modern naming convention alignment

* Documentation improvements:
  - Corrected spelling and grammar in about.txt (Australian English)
  - Updated thanks.txt to clarify sole maintainer status
  - Proper crediting of past contributors

* Build infrastructure enhancements:
  - Reliable timestamp generation for builds
  - Consistent executable naming convention
  - Error handling and validation in build process

4.1.3 - ie refresh in progress

* fixed front append option

* fixed regex option for remove

* fixed dots to spaces function (was droppping file extensions).

4.1.2 - ie refresh in progress

* enumerate fixed and added a new option: string
  string allows you to wrap the enumerated digit in a start and end string of your choosing.
  3 new cli options added
  --enum-add-strings			enables padding enum digit like so: <front><digit><end>
  --enum-string-(front|start)=<front>	sets enum-add-strings, sets front to <front>
  --enum-string-(end|stop)=<end>	sets enum-add-strings, sets end to <end>

* added clear button to MP3 tab to clear that tabs settings

* ogg's get their id3 tags written

* new option in misc "pad N to NN" eg:
  Artist - 1 - track.ogg
  to
  Artist - 01 - track.ogg

* clear button works again and also clears log window

* guess tags now correctly guesses tags AFTER all tag modifications

*  only show needed amont of columns (correctly this time).

* fixname::fix - added quit errors to catch undef filenames and '' as filenames

* ls_dir now only shows necessary headers + massive cleanup

* massive overhaul of nf_print::p
  only shows files & dirs

* drastic overhaul of mp3 library.
  updated to use new methods of writing tags, as my old method is now depreciated
  new methods enabled writing to ogg files and other audio formats.
  information for mp3 (audio files) tags are stored in a hash whenever possible

*  rm_tags now removed both id3v1 and id3v2

* id3 tags supported on the following file types: mp3, mp2, ogg, mpg, mpeg, mp4, aiff, flac, ape, ram, mpc
  WIP - currently ogg's don't get their id3 tags written

* make_test_dir.pl updated. now sets mimetypes for music files (allows testing of mp3 tags)

* rc_menu
  delete can now delete a directory - shows dir contents in dialog

* config
  all configurable options shifted to TSV $HOME/.namefix.pl/config_hash.tsv

* filter regex
  now users quotemeta

* fn_sp_word now uses quotemeta

* all libraries updated to proper library format

* bookmarks.pm no longer uses self generating code.

* mass libraries updated to proper libs

4.1.1 - ie refresh in progress

* about.pm is a proper lib now

* .msi & .exe's updated

* nsis installer script updated so it doesn't include .git

* Hot Keys Added:
  ESC = Stop doing whatever your doing
  F2  = Manual Rename
  F5  = Refresh current dir listing
  F6  = Preview current changes (if any)

* make_test_dir.pl updated - creates fake music files in fake album directories
* added cool progress bar.

* updating NSIS - probably quite broken on stuff like:
  ENV path,
  registry entry to ad namefix.pl to right click.

* adding right click Apply Preview to hlist
* update about dialog to refer to github: https://github.com/jacob-jarick/namefix
* created make_test_dir.pl for generating files I can test with.
* turned on strict and warnings for namefix.pl - redirected warnings for Jcombox
