4.1.2 - ie refresh in progress

* prevent starting new listing via double on hlist if a listing is already running.

* cleanup progress
  directory structure cleanup
  global_variables.pm is gone (hurrah).
  all shared globals are stored in config.pm - enables cli and gui to share nicely

* bookmarks file renamed
  fixed several issues
  code cleanup
  creating new bookmark correctly redraws the menu

* ls_dir
  now dies if you try to list twice - will turn off once Im sure there are no more double calls
  found and fixed a ls_dir double call.

* clear button works again and also clears log window




* guess tags now correctly guesses tags AFTER all tag modifications

* more cleanups. all die's replaced with &main::quit

* fixed columns issue in dir_hlist
  only show needed amont of columns (correctly this time).

* fixname::fix - added quit errors to catch undef filenames and '' as filenames

* alot of #'ed print debug messages

* ls_dir now only shows neccesary headers + massive cleanup

* fixname::fix - most subs can be sent a flag to enable STRING mode (dont do file detection)
  large overhaul - likely breaks namefix-cli.pl atm
  if fixname is passed an undefined file - quit out
  if fixname is file eq '' and mode eq FILE - quit out

* main::quit
  todo: add to namefix-cli as it quits differently depending on mode.
  clucks backtrace and prints quit message - so useful for debugging

* mp3.pm
  quit out if a tag is undefined





* get_tags should no longer return undef tags

* massive overhaul of nf_print::p
  only shows files & dirs
  code is much much cleaner
  likely broke several things buuut listing and previews work correctly again

* print command tidyup. nf_print::p is being overhauled for files and directories only
* all other printing will be done to the new console on gui. cli does not change

* drastic overhaul of mp3 library.
  updated to use new methods of writing tags, as my old method is now depreciated
  new methods enabled writing to ogg files and other audio formats.
  information for mp3 (audio files) tags are stored in a hash whenever possible

* id3v1 tags no longer supported (what is this the 90's ?)
  id3v1 tags are read only, removed and upgraded to id3v2 at every chance
  large update for get_tags
  rm_tags now removed both id3v1 and id3v2

* removed $tmp var from fixname. now using local flag $PRINT

* id3 tags supported on the following file types: mp3, mp2, ogg, mpg, mpeg, mp4, aiff, flac, ape, ram, mpc
  WIP - currently ogg's dont get their id3 tags written

* make_test_dir.pl updated. now sets mimetypes for music files (allows testing of mp3 tags)

* rc_menu
  delete can now delete a directory - shows dir contents in dialog

* config
  slowly moving all config to a hash which is stored as a tsv
  all configurable options shifted to TSV $HOME/.namefix.pl/config_hash.tsv

* filter regex
  now users quotemeta
  swapped to clear flag named $config::hash{FILTER}{value}_REGEX

* fn_sp_word now uses quotemeta
* $fn_sp flag renamed to $WORD_SPECIAL_CASING
* more tidy ups
* fn_sp_word works again

* fixed up namefix-cli.pl - works with updated libs. bugs may still occur

* all libraries updated to proper library format
  need to untangle global_variables.pm still.
  namefix-cli.pl is likely broken currently. been focusing on gui tidyup mainly.

* bookmarks.pm no longer uses self generating code.
  hacked some checkbutton to make it work

  ENV path,
  registry entry to ad namefix.pl to right click.

* adding right click Apply Preview to hlist
* update about dialog to refer to github: https://github.com/jacob-jarick/namefix
* created make_test_dir.pl for generating files I can test with.
* removed all references to $prog_dir, now using Findbin
* turned on strict and warnings for namefix.pl - redirected warnings for Jcombox
  created all missing main vars with our (not my), should have turned on strict ages ago.
  turning on strict has likely broken things, but gui fires up.

4.0.2

2:10 PM 18/04/2010

* Explorer intergration back for windows users (is not removed by uninstall option currently).

* added [Moonsong], Dvsky, aaf, sys to killword list

4.0.1b

2009.05.13
* fixed special casing (fn_sp_word) which was ignoring words next to . _ ( ) [ ]
* add comments to and corrected debug output for function fn_sp_word
* enabled fn_replace for id3 tags - if you dont want it run on tags, process filename first.

4.0.1a

2009.03.23

* cli_print does not guess at how to format strings (see <MSG> argument)
* nf_print and cli_print will accept <MSG> for its 2nd argument, this tells both functions to treat as plain text. nf_print still needs work in this dept.
* truncate will not error to gui hlist when file exceeds max length, instead it generates an error (proper behaviour).
* added sub, undo_add
* cli supports most options
* cli basic undo support
* cli help menu

4.0
Sat Jul  5 14:40:46 WST 2008

Tue May 20 19:53:51 WST 2008
* reverted fn_readdir removal of '.' and '..' back to a for loop. I had not noticed but occassionally a dir will list a file before '.' and '..'. this leads to a file being omitted when I truncated the dir array by two. This was a very rare occuring bug that I thought I had allready squashed.

4.0 RC12
Tue May 13 12:05:29 WST 2008
* blockrename filter now checks to see if a filter string has been entered (like main window)
* a recursive list now uses the same format as preview and run

* new global flag ERROR_NOTIFY - toggles error dialog's
* .. does not get listed in the new fields. (nice cosmetic fix I felt)
* .. was getting printed 2x, fixed
* added code to br_cleanup to prevent null values been sent to subs and causing issue mentioned below (was being caused by lists not matching in length, should a rename be attempted namefix errors).
* added code to prevent 'Use of uninitialized value' errors in fixname
* added sub br_txt_clean, removes trailing crap from new filenames when cleanup button is pushed in block rename gui. Handy for copying filenames from a html table (ie tvu.org.ru).

* if match_filter gets passed a blank string it will error - this shouldnt happen

* created ls_dir_print_passthru (little hack) so ls_dir_print gets a var passed from find
* ls_dir_print no longer uses \$_, instead gets passed a var like a  normal sub

Sat Apr  5 11:00:03 WST 2008
* undo now uses fullpaths
* made a little hack for file find so fixname no longer uses \$_
* colourfied the main guis buttons

* started work on undo gui (leading to multi level undo).

9:04 AM 1/04/2008

4.0 RC10
* start of blockrename preview (hidden for now)
* block rename uses fn_rename instead of perls, this makes it obey overwrite mode,
  fsfix and check for tmp files,

  rename, so editable left side of block rename would mislead user.
  Caught myself out on this one, hopefully noone else.

4.0 RC9
* logging added and currently enabled by default, logs to ~/.namefix.pl/logfile.txt
  debug level is set in global vars atm
* block rename: the original filename list is now editable.
  why ?, so you can trim entrys you do not want renamed, if the file does not exist
  it is just skipped. This was originally going to be buttons allowing top/bottom
  entry to be deleted but I felt this was simpler if not elegant, (it was also very
  easy todo).
* front & end append routines are run after all cleanups
* added kill patterns & kill common words routines to 2nd run like below
* replace/remove (same function) is run 2x, the 2nd run is just before final cleanups.
  This should improve matching user entered words
  example: filename 	\"Some.File.Ripped.By.Mem.mp3\"
           user rmword	\"Ripped By Mem\"
  would normally fail but now will be caught
* shifted listing of .. to top of ls_dir routine rather than have other routines
  attempt todo it themselfs.
* manual & block rename do not relist directory on exit unless rename occured
* depreciated &readdir func due to conflict with perls CORE::readdir, naughty jacob
  fn_readdir is its replacement.

* blockrename clean button now applys all mainwindow cleanups to list
  options are controlled by mainwindow still
* fixed killwords weirdness when using builtin list
* created gui update_delay routine......
  rather than update everytime a new list entry is added it does updates every N times
  has made gui alot faster :)
* id3 & fn case issue resolved thanks to fixing guess tags
