==============

High:

* make filter and directory text box resize with the main window.

Medium:

* add shortcuts: 
  F2, manual rename selected
  F5, refresh
  ESC, stop

* right click menu options:
|- file properties
|- delete
|- cut & paste ? - is cross platform cut n paste doable, and easily ?
\- PSR (prefrom suggested rename for this file now)

Low:

* multi level undo

* revisting fucking utf8 issues :|
* rename all flags nicely and uppercase.
* jpeg and other picture tag support.

==================
=- Known Issues -=
==================

* truncate from middle will round down to nearest even number
  - this is not a problem in my eyes.

* Unicode characters are supported, but some weirdness may occur on some
  systems depending on systems unicode support & codepages supported.
