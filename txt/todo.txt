Medium:

* add shortcuts:
  F2, manual rename selected - done
  F5, refresh - done
  ESC, stop - done

|- delete - done
\- Apply Preview - done

Low:

* multi level undo

==================
=- Known Issues -=
==================

* truncate from middle will round down to nearest even number
  - this is not a problem in my eyes.

* Unicode characters are supported, but some weirdness may occur on some
  systems depending on systems unicode support & codepages supported.
