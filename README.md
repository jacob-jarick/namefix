# About namefix.pl

`namefix.pl` is a **file renaming utility** originally published on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/namefix/) on **May 30, 2006**, making it one of the earliest and most comprehensive tools of its kind. Designed to provide a powerful and customizable solution for renaming and organizing files—particularly media files—it supports both **command-line interface (CLI)** and **graphical user interface (GUI)** functionalities.

With features like **batch renaming**, **regex-based renaming**, and **platform independence**, `namefix.pl` has been a favorite among technical users for decades. Its flexibility and ease of use have made it a trusted tool for renaming media collections, cleaning up filenames, and managing files effectively.

Over the years, several other projects have adopted the name "Namefix," often offering a smaller subset of features compared to this tool. Despite this, `namefix.pl` remains the **original namefix tool**, with a legacy spanning nearly two decades. Its focus on user needs and continuous improvements underscores its position as the most robust and reliable solution available.

# Future Plans

I aspire to rebuild `namefix.pl` in a modern language, perhaps **C#** or even **Python**. While I hold a deep affection for **Perl**, the language that, along with **Linux**, helped build my career, I see potential in leveraging my improved skill set to refresh the codebase. Whether through a rewrite in a modern language or an update to the existing Perl code, the goal remains the same: to enhance and modernize this tool for today's users.
