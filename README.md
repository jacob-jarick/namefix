# About namefix.pl

`namefix.pl` is a **file renaming utility** originally published on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/namefix/) on **May 30, 2006**, making it one of the earliest and most comprehensive tools of its kind. Designed to provide a powerful and customizable solution for renaming and organizing files, particularly media files, it supports both **command-line interface (CLI)** and **graphical user interface (GUI)** functionalities.

With features like **batch renaming**, **regex-based renaming**, and **platform independence**, `namefix.pl` has been a favorite among technical users for decades. Its flexibility and ease of use have made it a trusted tool for renaming media collections, cleaning up filenames, and managing files effectively.

One standout feature in the GUI is **block renaming**, which simplifies bulk renaming tasks. Users can copy and paste a multiline text of new filenames into a "destination" text window, while a "source" text window displays the original filenames. This feature also allows users to selectively remove files from the renaming list, providing a high level of control.

Over the years, several other projects have adopted the name "Namefix," often offering a smaller subset of features compared to this tool. Despite this, `namefix.pl` remains the **original namefix tool**, with a legacy spanning nearly two decades. Its focus on user needs and continuous improvements underscores its position as the most robust and reliable solution available.

# Future Plans

create a par file for easier deployment.

I do consider doing a rebuild in csharp but imho perl is still very much the king of regex.

build out test units to avoid regression, I previously did this manually with a set of files each with common problems addresses by 1 or more of the features, time to try and automate this.
