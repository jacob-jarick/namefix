# About namefix.pl

`namefix.pl` is a file renaming utility originally published on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/namefix/) on **May 30, 2006**, making it one of the earliest tools of its kind. Designed to provide a comprehensive feature set for renaming and organizing files—particularly media files—it supports both CLI and GUI functionalities.

Over the years, several projects have adopted the name "Namefix," often offering a smaller subset of features compared to this tool. Despite this, `namefix.pl` remains the **original** and most robust solution, with decades of development history and a continued focus on user needs.

# Future Plans

I aspire to rebuild `namefix.pl` in a modern language, perhaps **C#** or even **Python**. While I hold a deep affection for **Perl**, the language that, along with **Linux**, helped build my career, I see potential in leveraging my improved skill set to refresh the codebase. Whether through a rewrite in a modern language or an update to the existing Perl code, the goal remains the same: to enhance and modernize this tool for today's users.
